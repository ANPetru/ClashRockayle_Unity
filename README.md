# ClashRockayle_Unity
2 player card game made in Unity

**How it works:**

    -Each player has cards with value from 1 to 8, and 4 of them in hand
  
    -The player can play a card, and summons a rock with the card's health

    - When 2 rocks collide, the rock with less health get's destroyed, and the other loses the other's card health. If both rocks have the same health, both get destroyed

**What I learned:**

    -How to use UNET and connect a client to a server
  
    -Communicate between players when a card is played
  
    -Algorithm to generate random cards and draw them
  
**TODO:**
  
    -Add mana, each card costs mana
  
    -Take damage when a rock reaches a player
    
    -Win when the other player has no more health
